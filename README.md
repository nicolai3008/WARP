# WARP - Wide-Angle high-Resolution Prismatic spectrometer with polarization option

Project done at PSI, summer 2024, to create a high resolution multiplexing spectrometer, to replace the TASP instrument at PSI. Through this, a instrument specific McStas component was designed, taking inspiration from a component by Daniel Christensen, KU, the Monochromator_bent.comp, which is based on the statistics of SIMRES by Jan Sauron. See the component and the test monochromator component

## Forward Plan:
- Upload documentation proving the component works as intended (or as close to as possible)
- Upload initial WARP design using Rowland geometry
- Implement automatic placement of components in McStas
- Implement automatic Marmot geometry in McStas
- In conjunction with PSI implement entire instrument, and optimize
 - Optimize for energies and distances in back-end
 - Optimize for some of the guide and monochromator
- "5th Order": Check physicality of instrument
 - Check hight, weight, detector amount, which sample environents allowed?

This project is a larger collaboration with Daniel Mazzone, Jakob Lass and Henrik RÃ¸nnow. Write to nicolai.amin@psi.ch for more information.
