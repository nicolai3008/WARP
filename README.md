# WARP - Wide-Angle high-Resolution Prismatic spectrometer with polarization option

Project done at PSI, summer 2024, to create a McStas Simulation of a high resolution multiplexing spectrometer, to replace the TASP instrument at PSI. Through this, a instrument specific McStas component was designed, taking inspiration from a component by Daniel Christensen, KU, the Monochromator_bent.comp, which is based on the statistics of SIMRES by Jan Sauron. Furhtermore, in collaboration with Dr. Paul Steffens from the ILL, a generation method for mechanically curved silicon analyzer crystals that intersect several different rowland circles was made during the fall of 2024.

## Forward Plan:
- Documentatio and proof of component accuracy
- Optimization of WARP instrument utilizing Marmot concepts in TASP area
- Verify resolution function by comparing simulations with Marmot measurements at ILL

This project is a larger collaboration with Daniel Mazzone, Jakob Lass and Henrik RÃ¸nnow. Write to nicolai.amin@psi.ch for more information.
